	/// IF the total amount to be allocated cannot be allocated to each recipient evenly, then

	/// The classic example is that of a three-way split on a US dollar; after we
	/// allocate each recipient 33 cents we have a cent left over. In this case the <see cref="IRemainderAllocator"/>
	/// will determine which recipient gets that extra penny.
